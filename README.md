###Data Handling and Visualization: 
Import the dataset into MATLAB, segregate data into individual variables, and generate scatterplots to scrutinize potential linear relationships between energy output and other environmental variables, facilitating a deeper understanding of how these factors influence power output.

###Model Development and Evaluation: 
Develop individual linear regression models for each predictor against the response variable, compute model coefficients, plot regression lines for visual model assessment, use RMSE for model evaluation, and make predictions to test the models' reliability with new data.

###Advanced Modeling Techniques: 
Construct a comprehensive linear model incorporating all predictors, examine the model coefficients, suggest and evaluate alternative models using combinations of predictors, and investigate non-linear modeling for identified non-linear relationships from the scatterplots.

###Principal Component Analysis (PCA): 
Execute PCA to better comprehend data structure, calculate the variance explained by principal components, plot and interpret component loadings and scores, thus gaining insights into data dimensionality and potential reduction strategies.
